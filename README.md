# SIC-Linking-Loader

This is a na√Øve implementation of two-pass SIC Linking Loader by [Shreyas Joshi](https://github.com/shreyasjoshi1234) and [Yash Deshpande](https://github.com/chimms1) done as part of System Software course during Undergrad.

### Theory and algorithms are referred from the book 'System Software - An introduction to Systems Programming' by Leland L. Beck

Along with the final version, various iterations of development are also included which can be used as a reference by the interested ones.

### Usage
The program can be used in the following steps:
1. Keep the object program in ll-input.txt
2. Run the pass1/pass2 code which will generate corresponding output files.

#### Note:- We have used the bruteforce approach while programming the algorithms, which can also be implemented in various efficient ways. The code may also lack documentation in few places and might contain some workarounds to resolve errors which can be handled in a better way
